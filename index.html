                    I am a 28 year old Costa Rican student living in Puebla, Mexico, currently in my last semester of 
                    Communications and Electronics Engineering degree at Universidad beroamericana Puebla. In addition to 
                    my university studies, I have obtained certifications and skills independently, demonstrating my 
                    self-education. My academic development has allowed me to access scholarships and participate in 
                    conferences, where I have faced significant challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I particularly appreciate teamwork, resilience and commitment as fundamental principles. My creativity 
                    is reflected in my constant search of learning, exploring topics beyond my academic field in order to 
                    expand my knowledge and skills.

                <p>
                    Along my academic career, I have shown outstanding skills in innovation, self-learning, leadership and 
                    problem solving. My proactive and creative approach has allowed me to successfully face challenges and 
                    lead teams successfully towards common goals.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    My adaptability is shown by my ability to integrate fluidly into diverse environments. In this context, 
                    I have demonstrated my curiosity and constant desire for knowledge, which has enabled me to 
                    successfully face a variety of obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continuously pursue to expand my abilities in microelectronics and digital design, key areas that I 
                    consider fundamental to my professional development, given their importance in the industry and their 
                    crucial impact on technological advancement. I also have a strong interest in topics such as renewable 
                    energies and the development of self-sufficient systems. I believe that combining my technical skills 
                    with these areas of interest will provide me with a solid foundation to contribute significantly to 
                    innovative and sustainable projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am committed to continuous learning and constant improvement, and I am confident that my versatile 
                    profile and interdisciplinary skills position me as a professional capable of making a difference.

                    <b>Bonasa / IDIT 2023.</b> I worked with the company Bonasa and the Institute of Design and 
                    Technological Innovation of the Universidad Iberoamericana Puebla in the design and implementation of 
                    an IoT control device for water pumps. The objective of the product in question was to control water 
                    pumps for domestic homes. The system provided detailed data about water flow, pressure and power 
                    consumption. In addition, it had the ability to automatically turn on the pump according to the 
                    pressure setting configured by the user. It also had fault detection functions, such as low pressure, 
                    lack of water detection and pump motor maintenance. All this data was stored in the cloud and could 
                    be viewed by the user through a web application from any device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the project, I was in charge of the digital design and programming of the controller (C in ESP32), 
                    sensor calibration, design for manufacturing (SMD), management of the cloud database (Google Firebase), 
                    interconnection with the pump (Power Electronics), 3D printing and assembly.

                    <b>IEEE ICEV 2023.</b> This paper is of my own authorship and presents the development of a prototype 
                    water monitoring system designed to measure dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, salinity, total 
                    dissolved solids, hydrogen potential, temperature, and turbidity. Physically, the prototype consists of 
                    a plastic hollow body buoy floating in a body of water. The implementation of the device is 
                    contemplated in a lotic system belonging to the Atoyac River in Puebla, Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    The proposed system is composed of low-cost sensors and LoRa (Long Range) communication technology to 
                    enable real-time data collection, geolocation and analysis, providing an efficient and low-cost 
                    solution. The main differences of this system with other commercial devices are its manufacturing cost, 
                    easy implementation, sustainable energy use and its way of communication.

                    high frequencies of the heart sound, according to the user's selection. We were able to visualize the
